# A-lil-Fly

This is a fly shaped pcb where if you forgot to turn it off it will annoy you like a fly and keep you awake at night, it uses a light sensor to detect if its dark out so when turn off your light to go to bed it turns on. I really like this lil fly and its honestly one of my favorite hardware projects even though its not a very impressive project. I made this project mostly beacuse it had been a while since i had made a hardware project and i really needed a refresher from software.
