Picked My Parts :)
I picked my parts,

- C964831 for battery, its a small watch battery that i am going to use to power my pcb, i wil need to wire them up in series to get enough power
- C223838 for switch to turn off and on, i think i am just going to turn the batteries off and on
- C473834 for my blue led... its just a standard led
- C72049 for my light sensor which i have NO IDEA how to use
I am not sure how i am going to wire this stuff together but i will figure it out hopefully by the end of the day :)

11/24/25 4:30 pm (stupid youtube is very distracting)

I finished wiring the schematic

This took way long than excepted, after i figured out how to make the light sensor to work i asked chat gpt if i was right..... AHHHH BIG MISTAKE.
Turns out chat gpt is terrible at looking at schematics and figuring out if they are right and wrong because my wiring was correct... chat gpt thought it wasn't. 
Then i spent the WHILE trying to figure that out... but eventually i realized chat gpt was being stupid so i hope this works..
